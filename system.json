    "description": "Rumor is you want in on the Bounty Hunting business and why not? You and your little ragtag band are already turning a few heads in this sector with your… novel way of delivering wanted folk. But space is a vast, not to mention, dangerously err, dangerous, and if you want to rise like cream, you’ve a lot to learn (unless you’re thinking of how Glururk cream rises, I’d avoid that entirely if I were you). My advice? Keep it closer and safer than your RAN rifle and never be afraid to refer to it, even during sticky situations.",
