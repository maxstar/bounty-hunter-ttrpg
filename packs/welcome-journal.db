It’s hard, it’s harsh, it ain’t easy and by the stars it ain’t pretty. Go in guns blazing, come out in a body bag. Bounties don’t just sit around waiting for you to show up. They don’t just politely walk onto yer ship. They hide, they fight, and you know what? They’re more desperate than you. Every. Damn. Time.”</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>“So, let me give you some advice: As a bounty hunter, you’re a predator. Find yer pack. Know yer mark. Know yer turf, know yer time and place to strike, and above all else know yer way out. Play it smart. Or you won’t be playing it long. Haja, you’ll probably all die on your first hunt anyway. Dunno why I’m wasting my breath. Just, remember this: Never forget that out there… you’re on your own. Ain’t nobody coming to rescue you.”</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><strong><em>- Tragador Domikin, Bounty Hunter Recruitment Officer</em></strong></p>","img":null,"folder":"DdXMatdNqjY3sEdK","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xNoezxiYTnA95owM":3},"flags":{}}
